[VERSION] 39.66.3
[NEWS]
[BOLD]VEHICLES!
[BOLD]PLEASE NOTE: Due to the massive engine and gameplay changes required for vehicles, game saves from the previous build 38.30 are NOT compatible. If you want to continue your game a Steam beta channel for Build 38.30 has been provided.
[BOLD]PLEASE ALSO NOTE: Due to these huge changes to the PZ engine we can anticipate many bug reports, and also the potential of operational issues on computer set-ups that weren't part of our IWBUMS beta process. Please report any issues here, and thank you for patience.
[DOT2]Nine different vehicle models are available, not including variants on these such as branded vans, or emergency vehicles. So the PZ garage runs the gamut from family cars to police sedans, to Spiffo restaurant vans.
[DOT2]They can be found outside homes and in parking lots, while keys can be found in nearby homes, in the vehicle itself or on the floor. Hotwiring is also a skill option.
[DOT2]Players can replace spare parts, tyres, suspension, brakes and more, all of which can be damaged by situations such as overuse, off-road driving and collisions.
[DOT2]Vehicles must be topped up with gas, have charged batteries and each variety of vehicle has its own set of replacement parts for players to add to their chosen transport.
[DOT2]To accompany vehicles a Mechanic profession and skill have also been added to the game, allowing for increased chances of successful part installation, and trickier repairs.
[DOT2]The PZ map has been expanded, filling in the countryside between Riverside and Rosewood with farmsteads, camp sites and various nooks and crannies to explore in your cars, vans and ambulances. The official PZ online map has been updated with this.
[DOT2]A lot of optimization has been done under the hood to make way for vehicles: general map streaming performance, garbage collection improvements, UI framerate changes, rendering of non-visible internal tiles to provide smoother play around tall buildings etc.
[BOLD]Other new stuff:
New Sandbox options: CarDamageOnImpact, CarGeneralCondition, Enable Car Wreck Congestion etc.
Player craftable double doors and gates (wooden and metal) added to allow for vehicle storage in player-constructed bases.
Added darkening to levels below player's z height to help sense of depth between levels.
Added an AllowExteriorGenerator Sandbox option. This allows generators to power exterior tiles, and for example can get gas pumps working after the electricity has turned off.
Changed Xmx values to 1200 from 768 for 32/64 clients (should avoid too many pauses due to the garbage collector).
Switched to a Cellular Automaton (from a Mersenne) algorithm for RNG: this could be tough for players to see an impact, but changes in value should be less erratic). Also changed the seed generation. Now doing 2 seeds, one for Lua, one for Java.
Changed loot respawning to work at regular intervals. Starting at 7AM on the first day, loot respawns according to the LootRespawn sandbox option (in singleplayer) or the HoursForLootRespawn server option. So if loot is set to respawn every 24 hours, it will respawn at 7AM every day. There is a new sandbox option SeenHoursPreventLootRespawn. When > 0, loot will not respawn at the next loot-respawn time in zones that have been seen within that many hours.
Display progress when converting an old save to a new world version.
Added font-size option for inventory (and carpentry) tooltips.
Added line in literature tooltip to reflect when recipes are already unlocked by Profession and/or Traits.
Added debug scenarios to help in testing for devs and modders (Create a new character quickly from Main Menu, setup params, sandbox options etc. Check lua/client/DebugUIS/Scenario/DebugScenario, can only be used in Debug).
Added a -Dnosave argument in the command line for devs and modders. Use it to stop world saves when testing involves the creation of lots of new characters
Added debug option to display circle around character's feet.
Added UI for admins to inspect number of network packets sent/received.
Added tooltip showing Username on the Scoreboard and Mini-Scoreboard.
Added tooltip to Claim Safehouse context menu option when player hasn't survived long enough to be allowed to join.
Increase java heap max size on the Mac to match Windows/Linux (1200 MB).
Added "Quit to Desktop" button for when errors occur while loading a game.
Added "/safehouse release" command so clients can release a safehouse they own.
Added Moveables.txt translation file (for moveable-object names).
Added MultiStageBuild.txt translation file (for creating/upgrading walls).
UI now displays multi-stage build options even if a required recipe is unknown.
Added "ReloadWeapon" keybind ('R' by default).
Added support for duplicate keybindings and made changes to vehicle keybindings.
ESC key / B-button now cancels timed actions.
PlayerDownloadServer saves zip files to memory instead of to disk. This may improve lag issues.
Added CompostTime sandbox option.
DayLength sandbox option now allows all hours up to 24.
Added new town zones and foraging zones, especially around Riverside.
Added mailboxes to Riverside, alongside other general decoration map-wide.
Added "ItemNumbersLimitPerContainer" server option. It should be used to limit the numbers of items possible into one container.
In-game UI renders to a separate texture FBO at a lower framerate for optimisation purposes. (This can be disable in Options should it be desired.)
Doors can now be locked from inside without a key - including commercial buildings.
Added "Fill Grave" command to fill a grave to its capacity of five corpses.
Added better zoom in / zoom out radial-menu icons.
Added ErosionDays sandbox setting. (-1 means no erosion. 0 means use the existing ErosionSpeed option.  Any other value is the number of days until 100% growth. The maximum value is 36,500 days - 100 years).
Digital-watch alarms now beep for 30 in-game minutes before shutting off.
Added a warning to the Generator Info window and context-menu tooltips about toxicity.
Added missing options to the server-settings editor.
Player must face doors when locking/opening/unlocking.

Game now allows only one faction invite dialog at a time from another user.
Rooms named emptyoutside (used by roof-hiding) are no longer treated as interior rooms. Emptyoutside rooms were placed in BuildingEd on roof-like bits that stick out from buildings as well as covered areas (at gas stations for example).

[VERSION] 40.30
[NEWS]

New shaders for times of day and seasonal effects
Storms that move over the map
Fog and mist that clears during the day
Rain and snow now look like they hit the ground. Rain then disappears, and snow fades out.
Improved snow and snow effects.
New isoRegions system to detect an enclosed area - player-made or dev-created - to keep weather effects on the outside
New player character temperature system
New Chatbox. Primary features include separate chat streams (safehouse, local, global, etc), customizable chat and more intuitive usage and commands. It's hopefully a lot more convenient now.
New system to convert objects placed by mappers so they can be used as functional game objects. This covers items like barricades, campfires, rain barrels, traps, composters, crops etc.
New functionalities for the PZ sound system. Formerly modders couldn't override sounds in PZ FMOD soundbanks, so when players find certain sounds are too loud or annoying (heartbeat, zombie alert, flies, level up noise etc) it was hard to raise/lower them independently. Details about all the game sounds now go into media/scripts/sounds.txt. A new in-game UI allows users change the volume of any sound they feel is too oppressive.
Winter is Coming game mode now works with new climate system. Seasons still impact on this mode - 'Summer' highest temperature is 0 degrees centigrade, and winters may drop to -30. After 3 full days a powerful weather period is generated, that will always feature a blizzard.
New MP Admin UI added: an Items list viewer in the admin panel. It can be used to quickly search through, and spawn, items.
New C++ version of ZombiePopulationManager. This system is what governs the placement and movement of zombies when they’re not directly on your screen, and this updated version should be an optimization for SP and MP – hopefully helping out lower spec machines and busy servers.
Reflective windows on vehicles
Skybox generation for vehicle reflective windows. This takes into account: the time of day, the Global illumination color, fog, cloudiness, precipitation intensity, wind direction, wind speed and the temperature of the ambient air (as in winter the clouds are lower than the ground)
Added 'sway' wind sprite effects for trees and vegetation that increases/decreases with wind speeds(default on, can be toggled off in options)
Added 'shake' sprite effects for hits on doors, chops on trees and zeds/players walking through vegetation.
Added new Spiffo survival guide entries about weather.
Added new clothes: Long shorts, Jacket, Padded Pants, Padded Jacket
Thunder sound now plays to all players when an admin bans a player banned, a thunder rumble is heard when one is kicked.

Added more checks to online usernames. They now must be three characters long, and not contain any of the following character: ; . ' ? \
Added new server option AllowNonAsciiUsername (default false). This can be set to true to allow the use of non-ascii characters in the username, such as the Cyrillic alphabet etc..)
Game now checks username in lowercase when accessing the database. So if your name is BLARG, but you type BLaRG you will still join.
Commands can now be temporaly disabled with DisabledCommand annotation. Disabled connections, grantadmin, removeadmin, servermessage and thunder commands. Help also disabled for these commands by annotation
Added climate and weather MP admin panels. Many climate values can be now be ticked to override what's happening on the map. Values set by admin will override any values set by climate system, weather and mods. System also shows current weather information, and gives options to stop it.

Added lights to neon signs.

Added separate Shadow extents from vehicle extents to allow for better shadows
Updated fonts to bold to aid readability.
Added a way to edit Admin powers (invisible, godmode, no clip, unlimited carry etc) in the in-game admin panel
Added back the Lowest lighting-quality display option. [Lowest lighting quality now doesn't use the circle-stencil and doesn't draw a
second pass of floor shading, so it is a help to low-spec users.]
Added Display option to disable the new roof-hiding feature for low-spec users.
Shaders now used to draw wall + stencil + lighting in a single pass. Difficult to tell how much FPS boost this results in, but could help.
Client now displays the first lua or script file that does not match one on the server to aid user diagnosis of things going wrong with MP
Updated menu screen with vertical rather than horizontal options - due to problems with taskbar in latest Windows Updates.
Added a UI to display status and error messages when attempting to connect to a server.
Vehicle dashboard now displays headlight icon in red if headlights are switched on but aren't working.

Added Packaged=TRUE to Remoulade so nutrition info is visible.
Renamed Disinfect Bandage recipes to Dinsinfect Rag for Ripped Sheets.
Increased the distance zombies spawn in newly-seen rooms when the player is in the same building. This is to fix zombies spawning right in front of (or sometimes around) the player in the large open rooms in the Mall.
Renamed Metal Tube into Metal Pipe.
Removed Pipe (plastic one) from recipes/dropping table, and now use Metal Pipe instead.
Improved the appearance of crafting tooltips.
Frozen food no longer allowed as the primary ingredient in evolved recipes.
Can no longer use rotten bread slices when cooking level is less than 7.
Added several missing vehicles zones (McCoy, Fossoil) & improved gas station vehicles spawning.
Car-battery charger is now placed on the ground and interacted with using a context menu.
Transferring water from an object to an inventory item now requires equipping that item. The amount of water to transfer is calculated in start() instead of when the action is queued.
