[VERSION] 41 - Initial Beta Release
[SECTION]
[NODOT] <CENTRE><SIZE:large> Build 41 is the most fundamental and wide-ranging update that Project Zomboid has ever had. <BR><LINE> We intend it to be a stable foundation for us to build on for many years ahead. For this reason too,however, we anticipate a fairly long public beta while all the various issues presented to us by community testers are spotlit and remedied. <LINE> Some key features, primarily MP, are disabled in the beta build. <LINE> 
<LEFT> New gameplay styles: Builder, Brawler and Survivor
More deadly ‘Survivor’ (Survival) gameplay balance – player can be dragged down by horde and feasted upon etc. 
New survivor abilities: sitting, sneaking, sprinting, jogging, racking, reloading, climbing, fence-jumping, collapsing and much much more. 
New combat, new weapons, new difficulty balance. 
New character creation – many, many different new clothing options both on spawn and discoverable in the world as loot or on zombies. 
New zombie behaviour: feasting on recent corpses, lolling against walls, falling over fences etc. 
Blood system that progressively bloodies bodies and clothing of survivors and zombies 
New injury system – movement and combat visibly hampered when injured. Lacerations now possible, an injury state that lies between bites and scratches. 
Improved gunplay: green/red aiming outline, new guns, improved racking and reloading, increased gun loot spawn. 
Zombie Death Scenes – zombies discovered in the situations in which people died. Prayer meetings, sports-viewing parties, survivor zeds wearing backpacks etc. 
Situational zombie type/clothing and inventories – cop zeds in police station, firemen zeds in burnt buildings, Chef zeds in restaurant kitchens, bride and groom zeds at a wedding ceremony in church etc. 
Clothing protection: different clothing provides different levels of protection from zombie attacks. 
Visibly ripped and damaged clothing.

Two tiers of loot priority – allowing for more realistic ‘filler’ loot amidst the more valuable gameplay items. 
Many, many general fixes including remedies for: floating cars, farming issues, inaudible house alarms, erosion shrubs blocking vehicles, desensitized survivors being panicked by crawlers and much more. 
VISIBLE BACKPACKS!

Now treats aiming/strafing as a zero-momentum state, like idle.

Only blends (with animations) to defaultWalk/Run/Sprint if isTurningAround==false
Uses animation-less transitions otherwise. This prevents the transition anims from doubling up with the turn180s anims.
ZNetFriends continues pinging in singleplayer, possible it's one source of FPS drop
Run -> Strafe -> Run now keeps to a straight line of travel. No longer does the strange arc movement during transition

Groups of zombies attacking vehicles now coorindated better to avoid them endlessly walking into a vehicle they can't possibly reach.

[NODOT]<INDENT:40> 1) The cursor displays a green or red outline to make it easier to see.

[VERSION] 41.25 and 41.26
[SECTION]NEW
Revamped mod system:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Updated the Mods screen. The mod description is displayed for the selected mod on the right side of the screen, instead of in the list of mods. Other details such as the ID, Workshop ID (if any), installation directory, and any posters are displayed on the right.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - mod.info can have multiple poster= lines to specify multiple images in the Mods screen.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - mod.info can have multiple description= lines which add to the total description.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The New Game screen has a button to choose which mods are enabled for the new game.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Each savefile has its own list of mods saved in a file named mods.txt.  mods.txt also has a list of map folders that is used in cases where parts of different maps overlap each other.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The Load Game screen displays the map folders and mod names used by the selected savefile. Since old savefiles do not have a mods.txt file, all currently-enabled mods are used when loading an old savefile. After loading an old savefile for the first time, the mods for that savefile cannot be changed, except by editing or deleting mods.txt.
The old Zomboid/mods/loaded.txt file has been replaced by Zomboid/mods/default.txt.  This file contains the default set of enabled mods that will be used when creating a new game.  The default mods can be overridden when creating a new game in the New Game screen.
default.txt also contains the list of map folders that was previously saved in options.ini (the old "mapOrder" setting that was used to deal with overlapping maps). If there are no map-overlap conflicts, this list of map folders is empty.
Added bBeingSteppedOn IsoZombie GameVariable to test if a player (or zombie) is standing on a prone zombie. Originally I was going to use this to prevent fake-dead zombies turning over when the player is standing on them.Prone zombies won't stand up if another zombie is standing on them.
Changes on character creation:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Can now save/load outfit (clothing, m/f, name)
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Can now select texture when item using multiple texture but no colors (jeans comes in 3 colors, but a random one was choosen everytime).
Tweaked washing clothes at sinks:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Clothing is washed one item at a time.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Items are washed in order from least-bloody to most-bloody when Wash > All is chosen.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Context-menu tooltips display the required amount of soap and water.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The correct amount of soap and water is used.
Added a display option to specify which modifier key used in combination with the mousewheel cycles between containers in the inventory and loot windows.  The default is Shift.
The "Walk To" context-menu command displays a cursor to specify the location to walk to.  This allows the player to click multiple times without having to choose the "Walk To" command again, making long jaunts through forests easier.
Items are now placed onto an adjacent not-full square when dropping items on the ground. This is needed since the loot window displays items from the surrounding 3x3 squares, and each square can only hold 50 weight.
Added an option (under Accessibility) to drop items near the center of the square the player is standing on, rather than exactly where the player is standing, for neat freaks.
Items now transferred from lightest to heaviest, to maximize the number of items that will be transferred.
Animation now plays when transferring items between main inventory and equipped bags.
Vehicle-headlight distance and intensity are based on the part condition instead of being randomly set  when the vehicle is created. Headlight width is also based on part condition. The Focus Up and Focus Down context-menu commands which changed headlight width were removed.

Updated community translations.
Added a nag panel that pops up the first time the user tries to access the Mods screen.
Added the word "ERROR" to the little red box of doom.
Zombies can now have random bandages (bloody!) on them, thanks Captain Australia on reddit for the idea!

[NODOT]<INDENT:60> Allows us to specify what to indent the first line with,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> what to indent all non-first lines with,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> what to use as the newLine string (eg. "\n", "\r\n", or anything else, like "newLine: ")
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Default overload uses System.lineSeparator,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> does not indent the first line,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> and indents all non-first lines with a tab character.

Added AnimStateNameTable
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- New classes: GenericNameTable, NameTableEntry, and AnimStateNameTable.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- The generic table provides all the functionality of an index-name, name-index table.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- Thread-safe, using locks for adds/removes/modifies.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- NameTableEntries have a name, and can have an index. Defaults to -1 until specified otherwise.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- NameTableEntries notify their parent table when their name/index change, keeping the table consistent.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- Initial implementation not wired up to Networking nor AnimStates, yet.

AnimLayers now sync to their parent
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- Each layer keeps the sync node and track cached.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- Each sub-layer checks their parent for the cached sync node+track.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- If none is found, then it uses its own.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- ie. Bob_Anim_Bags now syncs to the root Bob_Anim

Fixed reloading an empty magazine and putting it back into the gun after using the Eject Magazine context-menu command. Refactored parts of ISLoadBulletsInMagazine.lua into ISUnloadBulletsFromMagazine.lua.
Fixed using the wrong facing direction when calculating player aim. (The effect of this bug was that zombies that should have been in the aim cone based on the direction the player was aiming with the cursor-thingy were missed sometimes.)

[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Translated names of clothing items were saved, which breaks when the display language changes.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The selected texture (color of Baseball Cap for example) wasn't loaded properly.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The wrong skin color was saved after clicking the Randomize button but not selecting a skin color from the combobox.

Fixed not skipping the UTF-8 Byte Order Mark when reading description.txt and title.txt map translation files.
Fixed some confusion about which equipped item to use for flashlight cone width, etc. If there is an active light in both hands, the right-hand item has priority. This can be fixed later to allow multiple active lights, not just in the hands, for headlamps, etc.

Fixed not drawing the same background texture behind "halo" notes as is drawn for speech text above the player's head.
Fixed crawling zombies turning too quickly sometimes. This was due to WalkTowardState calling setForwardDirection() when there was still turning to do. (Turning is still herky-jerky due to not having deferred rotation in the turning animations. Crawling zombies still turn "instantly" in PathFindState, but not in WalkTowardState.)
Fixed lua error saving character clothing in the character-creation ui with non-English languages.

Reverted changes to getSkinTransformData() and resetSkinTransforms().
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Each AnimationPlayer can have multiple active SkinTransformData objects (one per clothing model, for example).

ModelInstance.reset() shouldn't call "Pool.tryRelease(AnimPlayer)" because AnimationPlayer is owned by IsoGameCharacter.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Multiple ModelInstances (clothing models for example) all point to the same AnimationPlayer.

Fixed exception in PZArrayUtil.newInstance() when the new array is smaller than the one being copied.


[VERSION] 41.39

Added ability to refill water dispensers
Drainable items now change their weight depending on how full they are
Updated credits
Added bracelets, watches, dogtags etc to zombies. NOTE: OLD WATCHES ARE DEPRECATED. YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND NEW WATCHES.
Added SetMeleeDelay animation event that can be used to set the delay between attacks. This is basically the same as RecoilDelay which is used to set the delay between firearm shots.
[NODOT]<BR>
New thing for recipes.txt: 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Normally a recipe source contains a list of hard-coded item types. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This doesn't work well with all the new clothing items. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Now a recipe source of the form "[function]" specifies the name of a Lua function that will be called to get a list of items that can be used as a source item. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> See DismantleDigitalWatch_GetItemTypes() in recipecode.lua for an example.
[NODOT]<BR>
Added context-menu tooltips showing the percent full of water-containing items when taking or transferring water.
[NODOT]<BR>
Added IsoRoofFixer.java to prevent falling through roofs not placed by the mapping tools
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - can attempt to fix roofs for falling player per tile or on a per room space below basis, defaults to latter
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - locations are stored in meta data save so it doesnt attempt to fix it twice when player removes these floors (per room mode only).
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - optionally can place floors that match the roof style, or invisible floors
[NODOT]<BR>
Added some more system specs printing in console logs
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Display item icons in the "Items List" debug ui.
  


[SECTION]CONTEXT MENUS AND HOT BAR TIDY UP
Added an optional way of interacting with context menus. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Instead of displaying child menus to the left or right of the parent menu, the parent menu is hidden and the child menu is displayed in place of the parent menu. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> An extra menu option is added at the top of a child menu to go back to the parent menu. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This behavior can be enable or disabled for each splitscreen player in the  Accessibility options. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This works well with a controller. Mouse users may or may not prefer this method.

Attached items (i.e. hotbar items) may emit light, not just items held in the player's hands. Currently the game does not have any light-emitting items that can go in the hotbar, but this could be used to equip a chest-mounted or head-mounted light.
The "Equip/Turn On/Off Light Source" key will toggle a light-emitting item in the hotbar if present, instead of equipping the item in the player's hand.
Pressing a keyboard shortcut for a hotbar slot will activate or deactivate an item instead of equipping it, if possible.
A hotbar slot is highlighted red if a dragged item cannot be equipped in that slot.
Non-weapon items may be dragged to the hotbar.  Non-weapon items could already be added to the hotbar using context menus and radial menus.
The left d-pad radial menu (which previously only showed equippable weapons) now also displays the best light-emitting item in the player's inventory.  This can be used to equip and toggle a flashlight when using a controller.
Added an animation to context menus when displaying them with the "Single Context Menu" option when using a mouse.  There was already an animation when using a controller.
Prefer to display tooltips to the right or left of context menus instead of on top of them.
When using the "Single Context Menu" option with the mouse, short submenus are positioned under the mouse instead of at the parent's position.
Allow items to be dragged to the primary and secondary slot icons to equip them. Dragging two-handed items between the two icons equips the item in both hands.
Display all known seed types in the farming context menu, so mods don't need to override ISFarmingMenu.lua.
Display the type of container selected in the loot window. This was already done for bags, but will now also show icons for clothing driers, washers etc.
Added a radial-menu option to smash a vehicle window when outside the vehicle. This option was already available in the right-click context menu.
Added "Toggle Models Enabled" keybind, F3 by default, so people can change the key that hides/shows models in debug mode.
Added "Toggle Animation Text" keybind, F6 by default, so people can change the key that hides/shows animation-related text in debug mode.
New "Wear" submenu for garments that can be worn in different ways: Baseball cap, Poncho, Fanny Pack, Hoodie etc.
Changed the On/Off button in the Set Alarm dialog to a checkbox.
Added an option to toggle aim on and off by tapping the Aim key. Holding the Aim key for more than 1/2 a second aims without forcing aim on, so aiming stops when the Aim key is released. Running will turn off forced aim.
The "Attach" menu for attaching items to the hotbar adds "(Replace XYZ)" if the item will replace an existing item, when clicking on an item in the inventory window.
The vehicle radial-menu option to lock and unlock doors also locks and unlocks the trunk when using a controller.
Players using the mouse can already do this by clicking the trunk icon in the vehicle dashboard.
The Attach menu options show the item to be replaced in a tooltip instead of the option name, to match the Wear menu
Added tooltips to the Eat submenu to show how much hunger/thirst/unhappiness will be changed, as well as displaying a warning about uncooked food and food that is better hot or cold.
Added "Cooked in microwave" warning to Eat submenu tooltips.
Don't wrap long lines in wear-item tooltips (the ones that display the bite/scratch bonuses)

 

[SECTION][TUTORIAL]
Added code for Turbo's new objective markers
Added homing marker objective marker
Added improved item highlights
Improved Spiffo tutorial window placement
Added (incomplete) work on controllers with tutorial 
Added zombie alert when player opens curtain to see feeding brothers
 

[SECTION][CORPSES AND GENERATORS TIDY-UP]

Filling a grave is now a separate action from burying the 5th corpse. It still happens automatically after burying the 5th corpse.
Burying a corpse no longer plays a shoveling animation. This was broken since the shovel couldn't be equipped while the corpse was still in the player's hands, so the shovel might appear in the player's hands and on their back.
When equipping an item in the hands, corpses and generators are dropped first in a separate action. Dropping a corpse or generator used to happen instantly as soon as the item was equipped.
Items in the hands are unequipped in a separate action before picking up a corpse or generator. This looks better when the equipped items are in the hotbar.
Right-clicking on an equipped corpse or generator says "Drop" instead of "Unequip".
Fixed "Grab One / Grab Half / Grab All" being displayed for stacks of corpses in a container.
 

[SECTION][CAMPFIRE AND FIREPLACE TIDY UP]

Charcoal may be used as fuel in campfires and fireplaces.
Each use of charcoal adds 30 minutes of fuel to a bbq/campfire/fireplace, instead of using the entire bag.
Charcoal barbeques can use the same fuel and starting methods as campfires and fireplaces.
Only clothing with FabricType defined (stuff that can be torn) can be used as fuel in a bbq/campfire/fireplace.
New "Add Fuel" and "Light Fire" tooltips show the amount of burn time for each item.
Stopped rain reducing campfire fuel twice as fast, as it looked like a bug.

 


[SECTION][MODDING AND COMMUNITY TRANSLATION]

Added a fix/function for radio modding, to allow for timing sensitive stuff like voice-over mods.
Lines in WordZed can now be prefixed with "${t:xx.xxx}" where x is the amount of seconds. This will override the standard line triggering limitations in the radio system and use the supplied amount seconds before moving to the next line.
 

Removed the hard-coded list of languages so mods can add new languages.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Languages are loaded by looking in the media/lua/shared/Translate folder for the game and any active mods.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> In each language folder, a new file called language.txt specifies the name and character encoding.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The old "Language" enum is now a class.  This shouldn't break mods (unless they were calling an unimplemented method).
 
media/lua/shared/Translate/XX/language.txt files may have a line "base = YY," where YY is the name of another language to use for missing translations, before using the default language EN.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> For example, a mod that wants to override some French translations could use this language.txt file:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> VERSION = 1,
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> text = French Mod,
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> charset = Cp1252,
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> base = FR,
    
Added map description.txt and title.txt translation files to the media/lua/shared/Translate/EN/<MAP>/ folders. These are now read for the English language so they can be overridden by mods.
Fixed untranslatable text "Delete 'preset'?" in the sandbox options ui.


[SECTION]BALANCE

Tooltips for freezing or thawing food displays freezing time.
Cooking time is no longer displayed for frozen food (because it can't be cooked).
Added a recipe for emptying a Griddle Pan.
Changed Empty Paint Bucket to store water.
Only digital watches show the date in the time display.


[SECTION]ANIMS

Enabled EarlyTransitionOut for 1HDefault and SpearDefault.

Adjusted the female bash mesh to look a bit more natural
Tweaked hand positions of 2h strafe left and right
Added style option to Rachel hairstyle and tweaked some other style options.
Added masks to eating actions to improve blend between upper and lower body
Adjusted Bob/Bob_StrafeAimSpear_Right.X and Bob/Bob_WalkBwdAim2H_Heavy.X as weapon was not anchored in hand
Adjusted 2H_heavy attacks to end in correct pose
Fixed a bone-reparenting issue that caused weapons to slide around in the hands, most noticeably when fast-forwarding.
Declared IsoLivingCharacter.bareHands 'final', and fixed duplicate allocation.
Reduced MinRange for various stabbing weapons to 0.61, which is the same as other stabbing weapons. Now that attacks take the zombie's head position into account, and the head is usually closer to the player han the body, MinRange doesn't need to be so large. The ranges can be viewed by enabling the Character.Debug.Render.AimCone debug option.
Fixed stabbing weapons without CloseKillMove defined getting jaw-stab attacks.
Fixed the shove animation restarting when the player starts or stops moving.
Fixed the player hitting vehicles they aren't facing.
Fixed the player's bit-while-sitting animation looping forever.
Removed duplicate transition in zombie/walktoward/transitions.xml

Updated transitions and anim variable sets and conditions to work with EarlyTransitionOut
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> All transitions are now listening to ActiveAnimFinishing instead of ActiveAnimLooped.
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> Using <m_time>Start<m_time> instead of <m_timePc>0</m_timePc>
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> Using <m_time>End<m_time> instead of <m_timePc>1</m_timePc>
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This allows us to fire the event at the point of EarlyOut instead of at the very end.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Prevents infinite loops caused by waiting for an event at 100% that never comes.
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> This should work just fine with all existing anim states, while fixing all infinite loops.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> To enable an EarlyTransitionOut for a node, simply add <m_EarlyTransitionOut>true</m_EarlyTransitionOut>

 
[SECTION][MAP UPDATES]

Fixed lack of generators in Kingsmouth and added new 'Hangar' room def
Fixed non-cutaway wall on Studio
General improvements to both challenge maps

 
[SECTION]FIXES

The player will ignore zombies standing on the other side of a fence if there is a prone zombie on the near side of the fence.
The player may target the head, waist or feet of prone zombies, instead of only the head. Targeting the head still does the most damage.

Fixed weapons having an extra 0.5 range. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - This extra range was only supposed to be used before an attack starts, to see if a prone zombie or lunging zombie should be hit.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - This shouldn't affect weapon ranges though, because now the position of the  head of standing zombies is checked, and it tends to be 0.5 units ahead of the body when a zombie is lunging.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - In theory, this will increase the range from 0.5 to 1.0 when choosing to attack a standing zombie instead of a nearer prone one, +0.5 for the head relative to the body, and +0.5 for the "extra lunge range".

Fixed being unable to equip a corpse or generator from a container if the player was carrying too much. This prevented the player grabbing a generator from a vehicle, for example.  It had to be dropped onto the ground first. The player was always able to equip a corpse or generator from the ground regardless of weight.
Fixed a lua error using the farming context menu to plant seeds without waiting for the previous action to complete.
Fixed chance of success and chance of damage sometimes being less than 0 or greater than 100 when installing or uninstalling vehicle parts.
Fixed cutaway fences looking jagged at the bottom
Fixed all of fences not cutting away
Fixed Bite/Scratch protection from Tailoring and TV shows XP gain producing floating values
Fixed situations in which Rip Sheets should be called Rip Clothing
Fixed interrupted 'Pour tainted water' into an empty container action resulting in drinkable water
Fixed Butchered caught animals not showing some weight and calories variation
Fixed many clothing items that couldn't be ripped
Fixed freezing and thawing times of food increasing as day length increases. I set the times to approximately match the existing durations at the default 30-minute day:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Freezing:- 4 hours. Thawing: 15 minutes in an oven, 1.5 hours at room temperature, 3.0 hours in a fridge.
Fixed the radial menu used to switch the furniture-moving mode not working.
Fixed unnecessary counting of options in ISContextMenu.lua.
Fixed lua error in ISMoveableInfoWindow caused by empty overlay sprites on furniture. Could add a "none" sprite to the overlay editor.
Fixed the player's model lighting changing sometimes after equipping or unequipping items
Fixed the UI flickering sometimes when offscreen rendering is enabled.
Fixed languages not loading on Linux and MacOS.
Fixed the appearance of the mods ui when there are no mods.
Fixed carpentry materials not being removed from the player's hands after crafting.
Fixed the OnTickEvenPaused event not being triggered when the game was paused. It was checking GameLoadingState.bDone=true, but that is set to false when loading finishes.
Fixed the container buttons in the loot window not being updated after picking up or placing furniture.
Fixed floating run animation after the player gets up after running into a zombie.
Fixed corpses and zombies on the ground not having shadows.
Fixed actions using the amount of puddle water on river/pool squares.
Fixed the clock not being displayed with the new worn watches.
Fixed the list of lights touching a square not getting cleared when moving to an area without lights.
Fixed CurrentCell.roomLights.contains(i) instead of contains(roomLight).
Fixed shadows going haywire on fast-forward.
Fixed being able to take dirt from a square with a farm plant on it.
Fixed being able to dig a furrow on an existing one.  There is already a "Remove" option.
Fixed being able to place dirt/gravel/sand on a farm plant.
Fixed leg-twitch while attacking with 2H weapons. The turning state did not have a way of exiting while an attack was happening.
Fixed zombies failing to climb over fences or through windows sometimes.
Fixed Disassemble context-menu action equipping a welding mask in the hand instead of wearing it.
Fixed zombies sometimes walking slowly into walls when they are approaching the player.
Fixed zombie-crawler/hitreaction/Default.xml animation being looped.
Fixed missing "Campfire Info" option when clicking a campfire behind a carpentry wall.
Fixed not being able to start bandaging wounds while moving, even though moving is allowed after starting.
Fixed the inventory-window and loot-window selections changing as timed actions removed items.
Possibly fixed multiple zombies getting jaw-stabbed by a single attack.
Fixed the Wear submenu not showing bite and scratch defense bonuses. The Wear tooltip shows which items will be replaced, instead of the context-menu text being "Replace X with Y". This was done because sometimes several items are replaced, such as when putting on a Spiffo Suit.
Fixed duplicating fanny packs and other items.
Possibly fixed the player attacking after finishing the stagger-back animation. Needs feedback.
Fixed bite and scratch defense always being green in the Wear tooltip.
The Wear tooltip shows the item-to-be-worn's bite and scratch defense as well as the +/Change, the same way item tooltips do.  "Bite Defense: 0 (-10)" for example.
Fixed the "Render Rain When Indoors" option not being changeable.
Fixed "Dismantle Digital Watch" recipe not working with new watches.
Added back "Craft Sheet Rope", "Rip Clothing", and "Rip Sheets" recipes.
Fixed available recipes not being sorted to the top of the recipe list when the "Filter All" checkbox is checked.
Changed some usages of Stack to ArrayList. Stack is synchronized which is a bit slower.
Declared some fields and classes 'final'.
Removed HandWeapon.directional
Fixed some lambda-related gc
Fixed the broken appearance of wrist-watch models caused by masks.
Fixed text overlap in the Disassemble context-menu tooltips when using larger tooltip fonts.
Fixed tutorial lua error when not using a controller.
Stop creating a new inventory-window tooltip every time a tooltip is displayed, just reuse the existing one.
Fixed the display of rotten-food hunger values in evolved recipe tooltips (too many numbers after the decimal point).
Fixed inventory-window tooltips not being hidden when context menus are visible, when using the "Single Context Menu" option.
Fixed lua error with context menus when not using the "Single Context Menu" option
Fixed zombies crawling over furniture jumping upright when hit by the player.
Fixed lua error right-clicking on items in the hotbar while the game is paused. Hotbar context menus are no longer displayed when the game is paused.
Reuse ISContextMenu objects instead of creating new ones each time
Fixed "... and 0 more" text in recipe tooltips when exactly 10 source items are possible
Hide "Condition" in jewelry tooltips (any item with Cosmetic=TRUE).
Fixed bug in RichText Panel and Layout where drawTextLeft was called.
Fixed "Rip Clothing" recipe not producing dirty strips from dirty clothes.
Fixed not reusomh context-menu tooltips instead of creating new ones each time. The carpentry and metalwork menus together created 60+ tooltips.
- Possibly fixed the "Game Paused" message not being rendered after quitting to the main menu.

Fixed some issues with the zombie climb-over-fence crawling attack.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The zombie's movement was restricted.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The angle to crawl wasn't always calculated correctly.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The test for the attack hitting wasn't quite right.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - The player's immunity to these attacks didn't handle different framerates (IsoGameCharacter.lungeFallTimer).

Fixed item.RequireInHandOrInventory being treated as DisplayName in ISInventoryPaneContextMenu.doEatOption() instead of an item type.
Fixed DisplayName for Necklace_Choker_Amber and Necklace_Choker_Diamond.
Fixed "Medium Silver Looped Earrings" being named "Gold".
Rebuilt UI2.pack to add a few missing item icons, and the blood/hole/patch textures shown in the inspect-clothing ui.
Fixed the Metalwork menu tooltips using the old DisplayName translations.

Fixed Lua errors when adding fuel to a barbeque/campfire/fireplace from a stack of items before the previous action completes.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This is an old issue where the same item is used by multiple actions in the action queue. After the first action completes, the item is no longer available for use by subsequent actions. This type of issue can be avoided by using the new ISContextMenu.addActionsOption() which adds a placeholder action to the timed-action queue. When the placeholder action starts, it calls a function to add the actual actions to the queue.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The new actions are inserted into the queue immediately after the placeholder action.  The function that is called can find available items of the proper type, so the items to use are determined when the action starts, instead of when the context menu is first displayed.

Stop invisible-player attacks creating noise which attracts zombies.
Fixed grass/vegetation showing over interior walls when wind makes them sway

Fixed traps exploit by placing window frames near them making them indestructable.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - traps can no longer be placed near windowframes/hoppables
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - if a windowframe is constructed near the trap after placing the trap first, the trap will consume bait but never catch anything

Fixed fossoil sign infinite pick up / acting as lightswitch. This will be fixed for new worlds, however existing worlds will have the problem remaining due to saved data
Fixed unnecessarily creating copies of clothing model textures that don't have blood, dirt or holes. This mostly includes bags, hats, jewelry and watches
Fixed the "zombie surprised player" sound not playing. This broke when we started spawning zombies in houses before the player entered the house. They used to spawn as soon as the player opened the door to a room.
Fixed text width of "Hair" and "Beard" translations in the character-info ui not being taken into account when aligning text.
Fixed not being able to knock down zombies by shoving with a knife-like weapon equipped.


[VERSION] 41.41

[SECTION]NEW

Enabled the "New Character" button after the player dies in singleplayer, so it's more clear that players can continue the save with a new character. This button was already available in splitscreen and multiplayer.
Added "Corpse Shadows" display option. Corpse shadows are drawn as a separate pass (along with player, vehicle, and zombie shadows) so could affect performance with lots of corpses.
Added a sandbox option to disable zombie lunge after climbing over fence (in the zombie lore).
Allow sleeping anywhere when the character reaches a fatigue level of 4. The sleep is short and has more negative side effects than a "bad bed".
Allow the player to go to sleep outdoors when it is raining. 
Added "Simple Clothing Textures" option to disable blood/dirt/holes/patches on clothing textures. The blood/dirt/holes/patches are still on the clothes but aren't drawn. Turning this on can save texture memory and possibly improve performance on lower-spec hardware.
Added "Simple Weapon Textures" which disables drawing blood on weapons. Turning this on can save texture memory and possibly improve performance on lower-spec hardware (but not as much as Simple Clothing Textures).
Allow multiple map windows to be opened at the same time.
Added UIElement:onKeyPress(), onKeyRepeat() and onKeyRelease() methods so top-level UIElements can intercept keypresses without having to use events such as Events.OnKeyPressed or Events.OnCustomUIKey.

 
[SECTION]BALANCE

Slightly lowered spawnrate of watches on zombies
Slightly lowered the chance for pre-set alarms on watches
Rebalanced M14 Single Shot Assault Rifle. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Changed model
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> - Now uses proper ammo (.308) instead of 5.56. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> - Magazine size set to 20
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> - Damage has been balanced to bring it in line with other rifles
Reduced damage for Wood Axe to 1.3 Min and 3 Max, down from 3.6 Min and 4.6 Max. Previous damage values were workaround for a past bug that ended up way overpowered when said bug was fixed.
Added hoodies to some zombie outfits.
Big metal shelves now require metalwork to disassemble, also gives metal bars & plates (previously was only screws).
Increased spawn rate of fanny pack.
Increased weight of rifles.
Lowered min angle of shove to stop shove working on distant zombies
Lowered max range of shove as the range "extends" when player shoves (as body leans forward, so does the range)
Traps can get destroyed when the player is out of range
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- when destroyed, a destroyItem takes the traps place, by default this is 'unusable wood' but can be set in the trap definition
"Put in Container" inventory context-menu option now shows the name of the container (if any). Hopefully, this will make it clearer that the item isn't going into an equipped bag.
Increased the range the player prefers to target lunging zombies instead of prone zombies from 0.5 to 1.0


[SECTION]ANIMS
Adjusted the 2-handed miss animation to leave the weapon in left hand during the miss anim
Disallow fishing when sitting on ground, as said action has no playable animation at this time. If the UI is opened first and player then sits before starting fishing action a forceGetUp is performed.
Removed excess frames from "zombie get up from back" anim
Tweaked blend settings for "zombie getting up"


[SECTION]FIXES
Fixed jaw-stabbing zombies through unbroken or barricaded windows.

Fixed UI updates slowing down when the GameTime.Speed.XXX debug options are enabled.
Fixed IsoZombie AnimationPlayer being freed, then recreated after death.
Fixed model-rendering debug code accessing AnimationPlayer from the rendering thread. This was the code that rendered the character's skeleton and other things.

Fixed unnoticeable splitscreen rendering issue when the game is paused.
Fixed lua error with the Horde Manager ui when the spawn location goes out of bounds.
Fixed zombie models unfolding when they first become visible.
Fixed NullPointerException climbing through a windowframe without a window.
Fixed the close-window animation not playing when using a controller.
Fixed being able to sleep in a moving car.
Fixed Movable-cursor not being able to pick up office cubicle walls from west/north side, also made them hoppable.
Added functionallity for any object existing as Iso and Inventory (such as radios) to be dismantable/scapable in their IsoObject form by looking up the inventory item dismantle recipe. For this to work the spriteproperties must be set to 'CanScrap' AND have at least one dummy material defined for the scrapcode to recognize it as valid scrapable, the actual materials returned will be from the recipe
Fixed walls on the same tile overlapping door when the latter was opened.
Added a check that makes sure the door index is always after the last wall and wall index is always before the door.
Added a tileproperty TreatAsWallOrder for objects that aren't walls but should be treated as such in the indexing (such as the shower glass panes)
FPS multiplier now capped to a maximum of 5 (6fps->30fps). This possibly fixes death by stairs, along with other possible sudden deaths due to lag related pauses, as time will not pass significantly during such a pause. 
Fixed some lambda garbage collection
Fixed duplicate Keyframe.BoneName strings (Bip01, etc)
Fixed death music not stopping after creating a new player using the New Character button.
Possibly fixed bug that treated walking zombies as if they're still knocked down, causing wrong target priorities when attacking affected zombies.

Fixed wrist-worn items clipping through long-sleeved clothes by hiding the wrist-worn items.
Fixed character-creation Beard Type "None" not being selected when loading a preset without a beard.

Fixed zombies ending up on their back when they are hit while flipping from their back to their front.
Fixed the "close window" animation playing when the E key is pressed on a closed barricaded window.
Fixed empty assault rifles in Burst or Single firing modes killing zombies.
Fixed clothing items that can't get blood and dirt on them from getting wet. This includes belts, jewelry, and watches.
Fixed SleepingEvent not working correctly in splitscreen.
Fixed corpses being drawn underneath stairs.  They still get clipped if they overlap a lower stair tile.
Fixed knocked-off hats being drawn underneath stairs
Fixed some cases where empty containers looked like they had items in them.
Fixed some invalid item types in the loot-spawning tables.
Print a warning to the console when invalid item types are in the loot-spawning tables.
Fixed some gc with item spawning.
ProceduralDistributions Lua table is parsed one time during startup instead of each time items are spawned
Fixed the hotbar shortcut keys not working after the player gets bumped just before an attack starts


[VERSION] 41.42

[SECTION]NEW
Added emote wheel, you currently press Q to open it.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Emotes wheels binded to Q by default.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Emotes wheel is now a long press to bring up.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Emotes wheel includes different looking emotes if you are in stealth 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Pressing Q (shout) while crouched will now have different text and smaller sound radius.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Swinging your weapon in the air (not hitting anything) won't attract zombies anymore.

Added new sets of anim for fishing with spears.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Can now fish with a fishing rod while sitting on ground.
Updated the MacOS application icons.
Allow medical items to be dragged onto the list of injured body parts in the Health ui. Previously items could only be dragged onto the image of the body.
Made right-clicking items on the ground more reliable by checking if the item icon is within a certain distance of the mouse pointer.  Previously, only items on the square that was clicked were detected.  If the item was near the corner of a square, the user had to hunt around to find the right place to click.
Updated map to include recent fixes and Ben's Cabin


[SECTION][DEBUG]

Added a Reload button to the lua debugger file list.  It appears next to the file name of the item the mouse is hovering over.
Added an in-game animation-clip viewer accessed by CTRL+F7 in debug mode.


[SECTION][TUTORIAL]

Quality of life changes and fixes
Updated with new controller icons from Binky


[SECTION][MODDING]

Moved the code for clicking on curtains, doors and light switches from Java to ISObjectClickHandler.lua so modders can change this behavior.
Added back code to IsoPlayer.removeSaveFile() to delete map_pN.bin savefiles to help Nolan on SuperSurvivors and other minor changes to make his life easier
Added a new item property called Tags. Tags is a list of strings that can be used to specify what the item is used for.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Instead of checking lists of item types such as Hammer/HammerStone or Saw/GardenSaw, the game can check for items that have certain tags. These tags are: ChopTree, ClearAshes, CutPlant, DigGrave, DigPlow, Hammer, Saw, TakeDirt. Also, digital watches have the tag Digital which affects how the clock is displayed.
Moved recipecode.lua functions into a global table called Recipe.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>The functions are organized into sub-tables Recipe.OnCreate, Recipe.OnGiveXP, and Recipe.OnTest.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>This is similar to how vehicle-script lua functions work.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>For example, CutFish_TestIsValid is now Recipe.OnTest.CutFish.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>The old function names are still available to avoid breaking mods.
Error messages are printed to the console when loading a game if any recipe's OnCreate, OnGiveXP, or OnTest methods are undefined.


[SECTION]BALANCE

Reduced crit chance of knives.
Ignore the slowdown from injures, negative moodles, etc when closing or opening vehicle doors.
Reduced the distance at which light switches can be clicked on.
Ball-Peen Hammer can now be used for carpentry etc.
Spears used for fishing lose condition when damaged, and don't disappear from the player's inventory.
If you were about to do a close knife kill (jaw stab) forbidden when zombies are attacking - but your alternate normal attack will deal more damage. This avoids risk of unwanted jaw stabs when you have high small blade skills.
Increased reloading/aiming XP gain when level is under 5.
Increased minimum damage of M14 from 1 to 1.2.


[SECTION]ANIMS

Hide left-hand items when reloading firearms.
Hide any left-hand item when chopping down trees.
Tweaked normal glasses UV's so the arms show, male and female versions.

Fixed being able to fish from infinite distance, you'll now need to be at max 6 tiles from body of water with a rod and 2 tiles with spears.
Fixed various issues with moveables - primarily metal ones.
Fixed vehicles not colliding with zombies after the engine shuts off while the vehicle is still moving.
Fixed zombies sometimes attacking instead of playing their hit-reaction animation. 
Fixed animation event garbage collection.

Fixed not being able to jaw-stab a zombie from behind when the zombie was playing the Zombie_DoorClaw animation.
Fixed action animations (like reading) not playing when sitting on the ground after trying to attack while sitting.
Fixed timed actions continuing while getting up from sitting after pressing a movement key.

[VERSION] 41.43

[SECTION]NEW
Updated with new controller icons on gameplay screen when playing with pad
The inventory and loot windows are collapsed right away when the player begins aiming, unless they are pinned.
 
Interrupt zombies climbing through windows if the player is closing the window.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This applies if a zombie is starting to climb through a window, and isn't over the window sill.
Block the player closing a window if a zombie is climbing through it. The player plays the 'struggle' animation if a zombie is over the window sill.

Added "Automatically Drink Water When Thirsty" accessibility option.  It is on by default. Right-clicking on a water bottle when thirsty displays a new option "Quench Thirst". This option isn't displayed for food (such as pop cans), only water containers. Each unit of water removes 10% of thirst, as always.  So some thirst below 10% may remain after drinking.
 
Added "Leave Key In Ignition" accessibility option. When enabled, the key remains in a vehicle's ignition when the engine is shut off.
 

[SECTION][PERFORMANCE]
 
Improved pooled objects, which should in turn improve performance in areas of high zombie density.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> (On Six Months Later settings, for example, game was taking above 6ms to release an AnimationPlayer when removing one zombie from the world. This time has now been lowered to about 0.01ms - 0.03ms).


[SECTION]BALANCE
 
Removed attack that was standing in for a cancelled jaw stab
Added more floorboard stashes, including some exotic ones.
Increased chance of finding an annotated map
Increased the chance of finding a Survivor Zed
Refined the outline colour when aiming at zeds with a firearm - green now appears when the chance of getting a good shot is a lot more likely
Increased chance of clip found in guns or next to it.
Changed sleepyhead and wakeful sleep times
Added traps being destroyed in streamed world returning same items as when destroyed in 'offscreen simulation'


[SECTION][MODELS/ANIMS CHANGES]
 
Adjusted multiple bags and apron mesh so they don't clip each other
Made welding mask replace hats and vice versa (can't wear at same time)
Made it so earrings don't clip through hoods
 

[SECTION]FIXES
 
Fixed crawling zombies hitting the player in a vehicle when doing the fence/window crawl attack.

Fixed hotbar appearing for controller users
Fixed CTRL+A in the inventory and loot windows causing the player to turn.
Fixed missing function name in "xxx not defined for operands in null" exception messages.
Fixed not taking bullets from bags to reload a magazine when using the radial menu. Bullets in bags were taken when using the context menu.
Fixed being able to pour dirt onto water tiles
Fixed rugs/carpets being removed with certain actions calling addfloor (pour/take dirt, build floor)
Fixed some benches requiring different tools for different facing directions
Fixed objects not being able to click or added to context menu when 'under/behind' a collapsed wall

[SECTION][COMBAT FIXES]

To address issues of the player attacking a downed zombie rather than an incoming threat, there is now a fixed value of 1.5 for ignoring prone zombies.  When there is a zombie standing within 1.5 squares in front of the player, ground attacks won't happen.  This value is the same regardless of which weapon (including bare hands) is used.
Zombies standing behind the player will not prevent ground attacks.
As always, prone zombies will be ignored if there is a standing zombie within weapon range, which might be greater than 1.5.
 
Given a choice between two zombies on the ground:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> 1) Give higher priority to a zombie that is getting up.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> 2) Give higher priority to a crawling zombie (but lower priority than one that is getting up).
 
Fixed a bug where a prone zombie might be chosen over one getting up. This was due to zombies switching from prone to standing half-way through the getting-up animation.
Fixed infinite ammo exploit with RackAfterShoot firearms.
Improved the appearance of the aim outlines around zombies and improved colors.
Changed the "Aim Outline" option to have three choices: "None", "Ranged Weapons" and "Any Weapon".
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> "Any Weapon" should reduce frustration for some people with not knowing which zombie might be hit.

 

[SECTION][FITNESS]
[NODOT](Will require balance still, and will be put into the health panel next to temperature etc. in next patch)
Right click anywhere to bring up the fitness UI.
Select an exercise (some require items, like dumbbell), select how much time and click ok.
Exercise Fatigue will be induced approx 12h after the end of exercise.
Tooltips explain what stiffness does what (doing push ups will bring pain in your arms/chest, making combat slower, etc..)
The more you exercise, the more you'll gain "regularity", meaning the less stiffness you'll get from this exercise (each exercise has its own regularity).
System takes into account the impact of tiredness on the result of the exercise, nutrition, etc.
Includes "struggling" version of exercises for lower fitness level characters.
Some professions have existing regularity in certain exercises (fitness instructor, fireman..)


[SECTION][WATER TIDY-UP]
Changed "Quench Thirst" back to "Drink" for water-containing items.
Changed "Remaining: Percent" to "Water: Current / Max" in tooltips for these object context-menu options: Rainbarrel info, Water Dispenser info
Changed "Percent full" to "Water: Current / Max" in tooltips for these item context-menu options: Add Water From Item, Drink (from an item), Fill (taking water from an object into an item), Pour Into
Added a tooltip displaying "Water: Current / Max" when drinking from a sink or other object, as well as whether the water is tainted.
Drinking from sinks before the water shuts off, or rivers, displays "Water: Unlimited".
Always display the Drink context-menu option for drinking water from objects.
Drinking water from items and objects will reduce thirst to zero instead of possibly leaving some fraction < 0.1.

[NODOT]<INDENT:60> media/fileGuidTable.xml
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> media/clothing/clothing.xml
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> media/clothing/clothingDecals.xml
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The above mod files no longer override the game's files with the same name.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Mod decal groups and outfits with the same name as one the game defines will override the game's.
[NODOT]<BR>
Added support for custom beard styles and hair styles in mods.
[NODOT]<BR>
Added a new script item property named AcceptItemFunction which specifies the name of a Lua function to test whether an item is allowed in a container. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This is in addition to the existing OnlyAcceptCategory property which tests InventoryItem:getCategory().
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> For example, to allow only medical items in a First Aid Kit, add a line to clothing_bags.txt:
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> item FirstAidKit
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> {
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> ...
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> AcceptItemFunction = AcceptItemFunction.FirstAidKit,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> }
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> And add this function in a Lua file:
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> function AcceptItemFunction.FirstAidKit(container, item)
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> return item:getStringItemType() == "Medical"
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> end
[NODOT]<BR>
Changed Color.HSBtoRGB() to return a Color instead of Integer[3]. If you want the integer values, use Color.getRedByte(), Color.getGreenByte() and Color.getBlueByte().

[NODOT]<INDENT:40>See the commented-out Kingsmouth.getSpawnRegion() function for an example.
A challenge's AddPlayer() function is now called when creating new players in existing games.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>This is used by the CDDA challenge to start new players naked and injured, for example.
The "OnEat" item-script Lua function is now called with a third parameter named 'percent' to indicate what percentage of the remaining amount of the item was consumed. Also, the function is called before the food is consumed.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>See OnEat_Cigarettes() for an example of how it is used.
Fixed unrecoverable TextureCombiner errors when a texture couldn't be loaded.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Missing textures are displayed as a red and white checkerboard texture.
Display the filename of an asset that fails to load in the exception message.
Fixed multithreading issue with OutfitRNG. ImageData constructors throw exceptions instead of catching them now. 
[NODOT]<BR>
Fixed not properly reloading modified textures that previously failed to load.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>This doesn't handle texture files that were previously missing, only ones that failed to load.
Added a two-second delay before DebugFileWatcher handles changes to modified files.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>This is to address two things:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>1) The file may still be being written by another application that is saving it.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>2) Sometimes there are multiple events for the same file, such as a "create" event followed by one or more "modified" events.
[NODOT]<BR>
ISSliderPanel now checks for shift-clicking instead of whatever key "Run" is bound to.
Changed puddles rendering to use vertex buffer objects, reducing the number of calls needed to render them.

Don't clear the list of attachments in a "model" script definition when the same model was already defined.

[VERSION] 41.48
[SECTION][EXPERIMENTAL/NEW]
Added a new keybinding: Manual Floor Attack:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - Default to LEFT ALT.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - When you attack (hold RMB to aim, press LMB to attack) if you hold LEFT ALT too then you'll force a ground attack - even if there are standing/walking/attacking zombies close by. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This also comes with an option called Manual Floor Attack - which entirely disables auto detection of prone attacks meaning that use of LEFT ALT is vital:
 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> If set to false, your player will /!\ NEVER /!\ do a prone/ground attack on a zombie unprompted, you'll have to manually either press LEFT ALT & attack to them with your melee weapon on the ground, or SPACE to stomp while standing over him.
 

[SECTION]NEW

Swapped out attacking on floor with spear for a new anim, Bob_AttackFloorSpear.X.


[SECTION][MODDING/DEV]
Added loading mod files from the media/AnimSets directory.
Added optional versionMin= and versionMax= lines to mod.info so mods can specify which versions of the game the mod is compatible with.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Build 40 will not be patched with this for now. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> If the mod only works with version 41 or newer, add this line to mod.info:
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> versionMin=41.0
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>If the mod only works up to a certain version of build 41, you would use:
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>versionMax=41.999
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>Obviously replacing the ".999" with the build number.


Added DefaultClothing.lua to specify default clothing items for outfits that have default pants or top.
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>Previously, these were hard-coded in Java.

Only save RADIO_SAVE.txt if the contents have changed.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This is saved every 10 game-world minutes.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This is done on the main thread; we should avoid doing disk I/O from here.

Added OnCanPeform:XXX property to recipes specifying the name of a Lua function that will be called to perform additional checks on being able to perform a recipe.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This is a more general solution than the NearItem property (that was used for blacksmith recipes).
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The function takes two arguments and should return a true or false.
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> function CanPerformMyRecipe(recipe, playerObj)
[NODOT]<INDENT:80> return playerObj:isOutside() and RainManager:isRaining()
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> end

Added Tooltip:XXX property to recipes to display additional text in recipe tooltips and in the crafting ui.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This can be used to let the user know about additional requirements when there is an OnCanPeform function.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The value should be a translation name.  The translation text may have multiple lines separated by "<br>".
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> recipe MyRecipe
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> {
[NODOT]<INDENT:80> ...
[NODOT]<INDENT:80> OnCanPerform:CanPerformMyRecipe,
[NODOT]<INDENT:80> Tooltip:Tooltip_Recipe_MyRecipe,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> }
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Tooltip_Recipe_MyRecipe = "Must be outside.<br>Must be raining.",

[NODOT]<BR>
Added possible forced hair/beard color for outfit in HairOutfitDefinitions.lua (bandit/punk will have a chance to have more "crazy hair color").
[NODOT]<BR>
Added blood clothing type to every possible body location, so you can easily mod a new clothing to protect X or Y parts:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Example, i want to do metal socks that protect both feet and lower legs, i'll simply add a BloodLocation = Feet;LowerLegs, in the item script.
Full list of per-bodypart location: Bag (back), Hands, Head, Neck, UpperBody, LowerBody, LowerLegs, UpperLegs, LowerArms, UpperArms, Groin.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Each location will cover both left and right parts if needed.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Thanks modder Flash for the idea!


Catch the "Comparison method violates its general contract!" exception in IsoObjectPicker to avoid breaking the game.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>This exception can happen when compare(a,b) is inconsistent with compare(b,a).
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>This doesn't fix the cause, it only stops endlessly throwing exceptions.


Made IsoObjectPicker.ContextPick() a bit more efficient by calculating the score of each ClickObject once before sorting, instead of when comparing each pair of items being sorted.

Don't set Occlusion to 1.0 as that seems to completely mute some sounds.

[SECTION][DEBUG]

Added context menu option "[DEBUG] UIs > Spawn Points" for teleporting the player to various spawn points to check their positions.
Added a context-menu to the "[DEBUG] UIs > Spawn Points" editor.  This can be used to reposition and remove existing points.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> To save the changes, use the "Copy All To Clipboard" menu option and paste in the appropriate spawnpoints.lua file.
Added a separate menu "[DEBUG] Vehicle > Set Script (Smashed)" for smashed vehicles.
Allow deleting map_zone.bin from the "More..." load-game ui in debug mode.


[SECTION][LOOT DISTRIBUTION CHANGES]
Partially implemented new system As yet untouched loot tables remain the same as before.
[NODOT]<BR>
New more handcrafted loot placement / container system used for places like Giga-Mart and residential kitchens now applied to the rest of the map. Locations that previously spawned random grab-bags of loot (like Spiffo’s) should have their contents sorted into relevant lists: If you’re looking for a bladed weapon or some fresh-cut chops, try looking around the kitchen of any place that sells meat (i.e, not a bakery) for the meat-cutting station. If it’s baking supplies you need, look for where the sacks of flour are stored-- they’ll probably be next to a rolling pin.
[NODOT]<BR>
Convenience stores, corner stores, and gas stations have had their shelves’ contents sorted so loose cigarettes no longer mix with the lollipops. Players who visit the pharmacy already have an idea of how the shelves are laid out: Some have snacks, some have drinks. You’re less likely to find medicine in a gas station but it’s not unheard of-- ditto car supplies in a Zippee’s. If you want the most of a particular kind of item, it’s best to stick to the relevant business. Gas station tylenol is a ripoff anyway.
[NODOT]<BR>
Medical locations now sort their contents into tools, medicine, and doctor-related stuff like gloves, masks, and scrubs. Bars, beauty salons, butcher shops, cafes, and liquor stores all take the same approach. Giant ‘catch all’ loot lists should eventually be replaced with tailored selections of items that are relevant to the location they’re spawned in.


[SECTION][MOVABLES]

Fixed movable items, such as radios from cars, having correct condition when placed and picked up again.
Movables can now be dismantled from inventory, except for the multi tile object ones i.e: beds.
Added MovableRecipe which has no script definitions, instead gets created on the fly from movable definitions.
Refactored some stuff so the MovableRecipe has the same chances, xp, resultitems, equipitems etc as world object dismantling.
Single tile Movable items are now defined as 'Moveables.world_object_sprite_here" instead of all being 'Moveables.Moveable'. This also means these movables can be easily instanced directly now


[SECTION][CONTROLLERS UPDATE]
 
Removed the old JInput library which was used for controllers.  The GLFW library, part of LWJGL 3, is now used.
GLFW has a database of several hundred Xbox-like controllers, including PlayStation controllers, so these should have a good chance of working.  Recognized controllers are listed in media\gamecontrollerdb.txt.
The user can create their own gamecontrollerdb.txt file in their User\Zomboid\joypads directory.  This can be done to add new controllers or to override a controller in the game's media\gamecontrollerdb.txt.
The game should handle controllers disconnecting and reconnecting during play.  If player 1's controller is disconnected, they can choose to revert to keyboard and mouse input.
The controller X button now rotates objects in Place mode.

Fixed "delete all" on bins not working.

[SECTION]MODDING
Allow modders to add new vehicle zones to the global VehicleZoneDefinition table.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Previously, only the game's zone names and types were allowed.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This should work for any vehicle zone not called TestVehicles or containing TrafficJam.
Added support for loading animations from a mod's media/anims_X directory (and subdirectories of that). It should handle activating and deactivating mods.
[NODOT]<BR>
Global ModData
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Registers moddata tables with a given String key.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> When Global Moddata is initialised during world loading it triggers the event "OnInitGlobalModData" with parameter: boolean isNewGame.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> LuaTable ModData.create(String key) creates and returns the table with given key, returns null if the table already exists.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> String ModData.create() creates a table with a random UUID key, note: returns the string key.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> LuaTable ModData.getOrCreate(String key) gets or creates the table with given key.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> LuaTable ModData.get(String key) returns the table with given key or null.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> boolean ModData.exists(String key) return true if table with given key exists.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> LuaTable ModData.remove(String key) removes the table with given key if exists and returns it or null.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> void ModData.add(String key, LuaTable table) store the table with given key (overrides any existing table).
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> ArrayList getTableNames() returns a list of all registered tables.

Networking
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Global ModData is not synced between server and client as depending on what the moddata is being used for this may not be required or even unwanted.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Syncing of data where needed is up to coder/author. There are however two methods for networking:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> void ModData.transmit(String key)
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> this will attempt to transmit the table with given key, when called on server this is send to all clients, when called on client send to server. (see note on receiving moddata below)
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> void ModData.request(String key)
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> Client only, this sends a request to server to send back the table with given key to this client.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> When the server or the client receives a moddata packet it is not automatically added to the local register.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Instead the packet is read and the event "OnReceiveGlobalModData" is triggered, the String key and LuaTable table are passed as arguments.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> NOTE: the table argument can be 'false' when moddata packet replied to a ModData.request.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The coder/author can then decide to parse, register or keep it as temporary lua table only etc.
[NODOT]<BR>

Fixed issues with setting appropriate texture flags when loading mod texture packs.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> World textures were missing the flag to create mipmaps, resulting in "sparkly" textures when zoomed out.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Floor textures were using compression, resulting in visual artifacts sometimes.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>UI textures were using compression and "mag linear" filtering instead of "mag nearest" filtering.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>When a mod texture-pack name ends with ".floor", compression is turned off.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>For texture packs containing UI textures and/or item textures, the mod.info file should add "type=ui" to pack= lines, like this:
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>pack=MyPackFile 
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>type=ui


Allow vehicle scripts to override the "model" without a name.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Previously, "model XYZ" would override a previously-declared "model XYZ", but "model" alone wouldn't override "model".
 
Allow mods to define custom sandbox options.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>ach file called media/sandbox-options.txt that exists is loaded before Lua files are loaded.
 
Allow mods to define custom perks (Skills ingame).
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Each file called media/perks.txt that exists is loaded before scripts and Lua files are loaded.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> New perks and perk categories can be defined.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This required removing the Perks enum.  Now Perks is a class containing static instances of Perk.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> So Perks.Strength is now the Strength perk itself instead of an enum value.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>The Lua Perks table contains the predefined perks and also any custom perks.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Fortunately, these changes didn't require any changes to Lua files. 


Added textureShadow property to vehicle scripts to allow overriding the shadow texture.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>For example, write "textureShadow = schoolbag_spiffo," without quotes.


recipe.Prop1 and recipe.Prop2 can specify a source item to display in the player's hand.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>For example, Prop1:Source=2 will use either the Saw or GardenSaw model:
 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>recipe Saw Logs
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>{
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>Log,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>keep Saw/GardenSaw,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>Prop1:Source=2,
[NODOT]<INDENT:60>Prop2:Log,
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>}
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>The Log model could also be specified as Prop2:Source=1.


Vehicle windows will have color from the textureLights texture applied. This was added for the boat mod. Call BaseVehicle.setWindowLightsOn(true|false) to control this.  This setting isn't saved, or synced in multiplayer.

Vehicle-shadow size and position may be set using the shadowExtents and shadowOffset properties in vehicle scripts. These can be edited in the vehicle editor, under the Chassis section.


Fixed "Mod: XYZ" in item tooltips for mod items always displaying the name of the last mod loaded.
Added Tooltip.ModName debug option to control displaying "Mod: XYZ" in item tooltips for mod items.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This could be changed to a Display option if wanted (translations needed though).

Added GameTime helicopter-related methods for mods:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> int getHelicopterDay()
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> setHelicopterDay(int day)
 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> int getHelicopterStartHour()
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> setHelicopterStartHour(int hour) // 0-24
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> int getHelicopterEndHour()
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> setHelicopterEndHour(int hour) // 0-24

 
[SECTION][TECHNICAL]

Optimized game variable look-ups.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>AnimCondition no longer repeatedly searches for the same variable by name.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Instead, it creates an AnimationVariableHandle and re-uses it.
GameProfiler.invokeAndMeasure now check whether or not the recorder is running, and avoid capturing a new Lambda

Performance improvement. Added an early-out to updateTwistBone
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>If the current twist is <1 degree, the function aborts.
[NODOT]<BR>
[NODOT]Savegame compression optimization from Turbo
Refactored and tidied up WorldDictionary.
Server now sends the WorldDictionary data to clients when connecting.
Client now only saves WorldDictionaryReadable.lua in game folder.
WorldDictionary now respects Core.noSave.
World loading should now abort correctly if any problems are found with the dictionary.
Added method getModID(), getModName() and isVanilla() to InventoryItem.
Added the mod name which added the item, and optionally any overrides, to item tooltip.
[NODOT]<BR>
Performance improvements to BoneTransform calculations for a 2x boost to animation system.
[NODOT]<BR>
Fog optimization
Memory optimization: placed IsoGridSquare.collideMatrix, IsoGridSquare.pathMatrix and IsoGridSquare.visionMatrix arrays to 32 bit integer and wrote bit access functions for those.
[NODOT]<BR>
Refactored IsoRegion system
[NODOT]<BR> including optimized region calculations and fixes for a bunch of things that could cause bugs.
Added new IsoRegion debugger based of ZombiePopulationWindow (can build via debugger now for quick testing).
[NODOT]<BR>
Added IsoRegionLogger, logs can be viewed via debugger.
WorldDictionary -> disabled logging of missing object ID.
Colors.java -> added GetColorFromIndex, GetColorsCount.
[NODOT]<BR>
Added Character.Debug.Render.Vision option to display the player's vision cone and see-nearby-characters radius.
[NODOT]<BR>
Use the proper distance instead of Manhattan distance in IsoPlayer.updateLOS().
Fixed IsoGameCharacter.updateSeenVisibility() not handling the see-nearby-characters radius, resulting in zombies behind the player (or nearby but outside the vision cone) not becoming visible when they should
[NODOT]<BR>
Don't use shared animations on the nearest 20 zombies, to avoid foot-sliding when they're lunging. IsoWorld.sceneCullZombies() already sorts zombies by visibility and distance, so it is used to set a flag on zombies that shouldn't use shared animations.
[NODOT]<BR>
Removed IsoPlayer.m_moveDelta because IsoGameCharacter.m_moveDelta already exists.  The value is always 1.0 in any case

[VERSION] 41.52

[SECTION][MODDING]

Added IsoGameCharacter.getOutfitName()


[SECTION]FIXES

[VERSION] 41.53
[NEWS]
[BOLD]PLEASE NOTE:
[BOLD]This patch includes a fix to a longstanding bug.
[BOLD]We have always wanted to have the mouse cursor disappear when you prepare for a melee strike so that only the Iso-cursor is visible, as it will mean that new players find it easier to adjust to PZ's combat.
[BOLD]If you find this fix weird/annoying then we have also added a Display option to toggle it back to how it was before: "Show Mouse Cursor While Aiming".

[SECTION]NEW
"Remove Curtains" works the way it used to, giving the player a Sheet.
Added a tooltip to tell the player they'll get a sheet, and that they can pick up the curtains using the furniture tool.
(We may adjust sheet loot again in future by letting you take them off beds, or having more to loot in bedrooms etc)

Don't display the option to plumb a sink if there isn't a water source overhead.
Allow plumbing a sink if the water source is directly overhead (as opposed to requiring a square adjacent to the square overhead).

Reverted the change that checked for tainted water in rain collectors connected to plumbed sinks. We intend to improve on this system at a later date.

Added "Lock Cursor To Window" display option. This keeps the mouse pointer inside the window.  Alt-Tab must be used to switch applications.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>When enabled, the game renders its own cursor and the system cursor is hidden.

- Combined "Fullscreen" and "Borderless Window" options into a combobox with these three options:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Fullscreen
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Borderless Windowed
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Windowed
 "Borderless Windowed" ignores the resolution set in the options. The window is resized to whatever the desktop resolution is set to.

Hide the mouse cursor when the "iso aiming cursor" is visible.
Added Display option "Show Mouse Cursor While Aiming".
Force the mouse cursor to be visible whenever it is over any UIElement.
Force the mouse cursor to be visible whenever the mouse-using player's context menu or radial menu is visible.


[SECTION]BALANCE

Increased the threshold at which you can't sprint because of clothing.
Reduced some RunSpeedModifier on some clothings.


[SECTION]FIXES

Fixed VehicleEngineRPM.reset() NullPointerException.
Fixed incorrect choosing of random mannequin outfits.
Fixed (possibly) seams sometimes appearing between the masked parts of clothing textures.
Fixed silent knife attacks that are in jaw-stab range when no jaw-stab occurs.
Fixed being able to place furniture-curtains on top of sheet-curtains.
Fixed garbage creation with calling UIElement Lua functions from Java.
Fixed station wagon detail texture
Fixed zed story issue by checking that all chunks covered by a zone story are loaded instead of only checking the north-west and south-east squares.
Fixed null pointer with adding tent via stories.
Fixed minor issue in the Display class.  It has no effect unless the game window resolution is higher than desktop resolution.
Fixed sprint issue in tutorial

Fixed translation IGUI_NeedToBeStandingInside appearing where IGUI_MustPlaceRoomRoof was needed.
Added Linux docker.sh scripts.
Fixed missing languages on MacOS.
Added ISComboBox.setEditable() to allow filtering the choices in a combobox by typing. This is used in the vehicle editor and attachment editor to make them a bit easier to use.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> - ISTextEntryBox.onPressDown() .onPressUp() and .onOtherKey() are passed the ISTextEntryBox object as the first argument.  Previously, .onPressDown() and .onPressUp() weren't passed any arguments, and .onOtherKey() was passed only the key that was pressed. The change to .onOtherKey() is the only incompatible change.
Added ISTextEntryBox.selectAll().
Hopefully fixed fullscreen on MacOS

[VERSION] 41.54
[NEWS]
Added Noiseworks Sound Revamp - Stage #1

[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Stage #2 is going to introduce a wider range for zombie voice sets as well as further improvements to the music and ambiance systems. Melee weapon SFX - currently mostly based on material rather than the weapon in question - will also get more specific to the weapons themselves; same goes for firearms.<LINE>

Added VHS, CDs etc.

[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Media line effects will apply only once per player upon first time listening.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Home VHS's spawn uniquely.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Retail CD and VHS can have 'common', 'rare', 'very rare' spawn chance.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Added learnRecipe method to gamecharacter. Adds the ability to learn recipes via the radio line codes.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Added new translation file 'recorded_media_EN.txt'. This translation set keeps a translation of the english versions which can be retrieved seperatly. (needed for LCD which only supports basic ASCII chars)
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Added event 'OnInitRecordedMedia' to setup any recorded media data, see ISRecordedMedia.lua for modding.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Added new Media UI section to device control panel.

[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Changed display of overhead notifications for skills etc
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> - Softer pastel colors and outlining, red for negative green for positive effect
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> - Replaced skill/stat effect numbers by arrow up or down
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Small overhead text for skills and stats are no longer being displayed if there is no effect on their value.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Removed overhead text code from ISRadioInteractions
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Added static class HaloTextHelper.java for more universal use of the overhead text.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Added a few functions to add text, options for color and usage of the indicator arrows.
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> - If a text is already being displayed the next text is briefly queued.
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> - If multiple text are being added on same tick or while queueing they are combined and seperated with a grey ','.
[NODOT]<INDENT:60> - If a text is added which is already being displayed, it's discarded.
[NODOT]<BR>

Heart UI icon will shake when player character takes damage. It will stop shaking once the player is no longer losing health. 
Draw a faint border around the player's health bar so the amount of lost health is easier to see.
When crafting, items will be put back in their original container/bag. E.g. when adding Salt to a Salad, the salt will be grabbed from a counter, used, and put back.
Upgrading walls (multi-stage building) takes items from the ground similar to carpentry.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This includes opening boxes of nails automatically.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> For metal walls, propane will be used from multiple propane torches as needed. Only one propane torch needs to be in inventory, and it may be empty, as others will be used from the ground.
  
Removed StopCar and HitByCar properties from one of the walls_exterior_house_01 south-east wall pillars.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The properties were only on one of the several south-east wall pillars.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> This put "tree" physics on the center of the square.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> These pillars should be removed when one of the two adjacent walls is removed.
 
  
Added 3D models for items placed in the world. <LINE> Right Clicking an item will show the "Place Item" option. This will display a rendered model of this item and highlight the square to know where it is being placed. On controllers, the item is currently always placed at the center of a square.
Items automatically go on a table/counter if the mouse is over one of them.
Press R to rotate clockwise, shift+R to rotate anti-clockwise.
If you select multiple items and one does not have a 3D model yet, you'll simply drop it at your feet.
Fixed rotation speed at different framerates.
Added snapping to the nearest 5 degrees.
Place items one at a time at the current rotation. 
Shift-click to place all items. With a controller, the X button toggles between placing one or placing all.
Improved lighting of 3d items in-world, to closer match the tiles lighting.
Added rotation to the lighting in 3d items in world, before their lighting would rotate along with the item when rotated.
Improved lighting on all 3d objects, characters, vehicles, items etc.
Added "itemHeight" so players can place things on a microwave that is on a table for example.
If you have a counter with a shelve on top of it, you can press tab to change the height of the item.
Default "Iso Cursor Visibility" changed to 50% due to the regular cursor being hidden by default.
3D items can be disabled in the options.
Table stories. Random chance to have some stuff on a basic home's table to tell a story.
Multi-stage building QoL: Now if you upgrade a wall frame, wall, etc, you'll have the item displayed until you press ESC (like normal building), allowing to build multiples without having to use the right click context menu every time.
Added a "Can't Sprint"-moodle which will appear when the character is unable to sprint. The moodle will shake for a bit when you can't sprint but try to.
The character-creation "Save" button dialog now fills in the name of the preset selected in the combobox, if one is selected.
Require the player to be near a vehicle before the context menu displays refueling options to fix gas E.S.P.

[SECTION]Last Stand Compatibility changes:
Player files are saved in Zomboid\Lua\LastStand instead of Zomboid\Lua\Players to avoid conflicts with Build 40.

Existing Build 41 player files will need to be moved into Zomboid\Lua\LastStand and add VERSION=1 at the top to work.
 
[SECTION]BALANCE
 
Allow plumbing a non-moved sink before the water shuts off if there is a rain barrel above. The water is still infinite for plumbed sinks before the water shuts off.
Allow plumbing a sink to an empty rain barrel.
Allow metal drums to be picked up with the furniture-moving tool.
Allow pouring water into metal drums.
Boosted loot spawns in stash.
Display what perk just levelup up on top of the char (like exp gain from TV).
Sheet ropes can now be attached to metal railings on balconies. (Currently doesn't work for fences on the south or east of a floor)
Car wrecks appear less often, but can now be dismantled.
Increased odds of curtains being already closed in houses.
Holes will be added to clothing after the check for protection, meaning 100% protection will always defend you from a bite and lowered protection from a hole will only affect future attacks. Thanks to PseudonymousEd for pointing this out. 
Shooting out of cars now has a more limited angle than the former 360°.
Player will now be unable to control the car while reloading. 
Reload time increased while driving.
Control of the car is also lost when shooting rifles, but not with pistols.
 
[SECTION]Distribution changes:
Updated distributions.
Added a weightChance property, so you can try to make X spawn more than Y. Defines all the weight chance in said list (total can be over or under 100, doesn't matter).
Added a forceForTiles property, this'll check that a specific tile exist on this container's square to spawn items from this distribution list (ex: force something in counter under a sink).
Added a forceForRooms property, we'll check that a room specified in this list exists in the building of the container.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Example: Police station has an "office" room with a desk, but we don't have ways to spawn more police themed items in their desk. 
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Simply define a new distrib PoliceOfficeDesk, and add a forceForRooms="policestorage" so if we detect a policestorage room in this building, we'll use PoliceOfficeDesk instead of a regular desk)
 
[SECTION]Changes to knives:
If you're too close to a zombie but there's another zombie chasing you (thus not be able to do a jawstab) the character will shove instead of stabbing normally.
Slightly reduced movement speed while attacking with knives, similar to other weapons.
Reduced Hunting knife damage a tad.

[SECTION]
Balanced some clothings Speed Reduction and Protection to be more consistent.
Small chance of having some house windows being left open.
Curtains can now spawn closed.
 
[SECTION]MOD SUPPORT
Added outfit zombie distribution (see example in Distributions.lua). Allows modders to add items to specific zombie outfits (e.g. bigger chance of finding ammo on police zombies, etc)
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> Quick example, add Outfit_ in front of the outfit name, like Outfit_Generic01 and define your loot table.
Added getters and setters to Recipe, Recipe.Result and Recipe.Source for mods.
Added a system for respawning zombies on island maps (e.g., Kingsmouth).<LINE>Normally when respawning zombies, a random location on the edge of the map is chosen as a start location.<LINE>The game then attempts to find a path from that start location to the chunk that zombies are respawning in.<LINE>This doesn't work for maps that have water on all edges, since paths cannot be found through water.<LINE>Map creators may now specify valid start locations by adding objects to the map's objects.lua file.<LINE>The objects.lua file is normally created by WorldEd.<LINE>These objects are rectangular areas along edges of the island indicating respawn start locations.<LINE>These objects should be right on the edge of the land next to the water (but not in the water).<LINE>Alternatively, these objects may be put into a file called spawnOrigins.lua in the map's directory.<LINE>This file has the same format as objects.lua. See Kingsmouth/spawnOrigins.lua for an example.
Added ISLiteratureUI.SetItemHidden(fullType, hidden) function so mods can prevent items being displayed in the Training Materials ui.

[SECTION]MODDING
Added ISCarMechanicsOverlay.PartList[].vehicles tables to any parts that don't have them.
VehiclePart.setInventoryItem() no longer calls setModelVisible(true|false) for all models, because this interferes with some mods that choose different models based on which item is installed for a part. Instead, a new method VehiclePart.setAllModelsVisible(true|false) was added that is called from these Lua functions:
[NODOT]<INDENT:80>Vehicles.Init.XXX
[NODOT]<INDENT:80>Vehicles.InstallComplete.XXX
[NODOT]<INDENT:80>Vehicles.UninstallComplete.XXX
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Mods that define "init", "install.complete" and/or "uninstall.complete" Lua functions can now choose to hide or show whichever models they want.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>Additionally, VehiclePart.repair() now calls the part's "init" Lua function (if it is defined) when creating a missing item.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>This allows the "init" function to hide or show models.
[NODOT]<LINE>
Added vehicle.part.setAllModelsVisible=true|false script parameter.  The default value is true.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>When true, VehiclePart.setInventoryItem() will call VehiclePart.setAllModelsVisible(item != null).
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>When false, model visibility is not affected when VehiclePart.setInventoryItem() is called.
[NODOT]<LINE>The game will look for mod texture-pack files named Pack2x.floor.pack (correct) and then Pack.floor2x.pack (incorrect) if the first file doesn't exist.
Added IsoGameCharacter.XP.setPerkBoost(Perk perk, int level). This is for mods that want to change an existing player's XP multiplier for a skill.
Added IsHidden parameter for recipes and evolved recipes
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- If true, this hides the recipe on the crafting menu.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- Hidden recipes are still able to be crafted via the right click menu.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- Evolved recipes are hidden unless a result item exists.
[NODOT]<INDENT:80>- This allows adding additional ingredients via the crafting menu.


[SECTION]CONTROLLER
Pressing and holding the left analogue stick displays a radial menu that allows toggling crouching, sitting on the ground, and auto-walking. A quick press of the left joystick button toggles crouch, the same as before.
Pressing the controller A button when a text entry has the focus displays the on-screen keyboard.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- Left shoulder button changes focus between the text entry and keyboard.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40>- D-pad navigates in the text entry.
Foraging / Search mode improved to work with controllers.


[SECTION]FIXES
Fixed a Lua error when trying to spawn a new character in game when the AllClothesUnlocked sandbox option or Character.CreateAllOutfits debug option is enabled.
Fixed the "Aim Outline" option default being "None" instead of "Ranged Weapons".
Fixed the volume controls not working in multiplayer.
Fixed Home VHS tapes switching from blank to not-blank after reloading sometimes.
Fixed some unique Home VHS tapes never being spawned. Now CDs and VHS tapes are randomized in ItemPickerJava.
Fixed translation files from required mods having priority over the mod that required it. If mod B requires mod A, then mod B's translation files will be loaded first so they override the same translation in mod A, if present.
Fixed sitting zombies facing random angles in multiplayer.
Fixed an IllegalArgumentException in IsoChunk.SafeRead() when reading an empty map_X_Y.bin file.
Fixed the mini-map displaying the game's map data in cells that have been overridden by mods.
Fixed some curved-road zones.

Fixed exercises not starting when a two-handed weapon attached to the back is equipped in both hands.
Fixed a thread-synchronization bug with ZomboidFileSystem.getString() accessing RelativeMap. This led to walls not being cutaway due to failing to load the CircleStencil Shader.
Fixed Character.Debug.PlaySoundWhenInvisible default being true when it should be false.
Fixed a few cases where sounds from invisible players could be heard in multiplayer.
Fixed bug in world dictionary when an item similarly named to a base item but with different module would be removed. This was due to scriptmanager.getModule defaulting to 'base' when the module was not found.
Fixed scriptmanager.getModule testing for equals("Base") or startsWith("Base.") instead of startsWith("Base"). This would otherwise result in the same error happening still if one would name their module for example "BaseBuilding".
Fixed item loading when trying to create an item with the same name in a different module. When a mod adds "MyMod.Apple" this a new item that exists alongside "Base.Apple", when MyMod is removed the "MyMod.Apple" bytes in the saves should be skipped. However due to ItemFactory.CreateItem calling the same scriptmanager functions that default to "Base" when no module found, it would try and instance "Base.Apple".
Fixed bug in WorldDictionary ItemInfo where print debug would not print all lines.
Fixed GameLoadingState doing GameClient stuff in single player.
Fixed any exception that occurs when the "failed to create vehicles database" message is displayed not being printed.

The server browser and favorites list will display "... and N more" after the list of mods, when there are more mods than are displayed.  This is to fix some servers reporting ??? as their version number, which prevents people from joining.
The server will exit if there are syntax errors in the servername_SandboxVars.lua file.
The server's servername_SandboxVars.lua is saved after loading it to update it to the latest version with comments.

[SECTION]MODDING
Made the maximum allowed tiledef file number 16382. File numbers 0-99 are reserved for the game, as was already the case. The old unenforced maximum was 1000, which some mods ignored. Sprite IDs must fit in a signed 32-bit integer (2,147,483,647). Each tiledef file is reserved 512 tilesheets of 512 tiles each. However: please note that values higher than 8190 result in NEGATIVE sprite IDs. Numbers higher than 16382 definitely aren't allowed due to using 32-bit integers to hold sprite IDs.

Fixed ClientPlayerDB handling of WorldVersion.
Transfer known media lines from recorded_media.bin to the player on the first load.
Check for null arguments to RecordedMedia.hasListenedToAll(). A mod seems to pass null for the IsoPlayer argument, which was ok when listened-to lines were stored globally instead of per-player. The mod file is es.info.books.main.lua.
[NODOT]<BR>
MODDER WARNING: This could break any mods that modify ISRadioInteractions.lua or are using the OnDeviceText event (which gained a new parameter).

[SECTION]MODDING

Fixed mod animations not being loaded if they aren't in a subdirectory of anims_X, or aren't in a subdirectory registered in animations_meshes.txt. Any such animations are added to the MaleBody model by default.
[NODOT]<BR>
[NODOT]Item tagging changes

[NODOT] MODDERS: PLEASE READ ADDENDUM DOCUMENTATION FOR INFO
[NODOT] https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/53019-details-on-the-improved-modding-tag-system-in-4169/
[NODOT]<BR>
Added new tags to some items: BlowTorch, Fork, GasMask, Glue, HazmatSuit, Knife, Razor, Scissors, Sledgehammer, Spoon, StartFire, WeldingMask. These tags are used in multiple places instead of looking for specific item types.
Added methods ItemContainer.getBestConditionEvalArg() and ItemContainer.getBestConditionEvalArgRecurse().
[NODOT]<BR>
Added a new item-script property ReplaceTypes which supersedes ReplaceOnUseOn (which is still supported).
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The format is "ReplaceTypes=Key1 Type1;Key2 Type2;..." where each key is some string (such as WaterSource) and each type is an item type.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> ReplaceTypes allows specifying different replacement item types for different uses of an item, for example, filling an empty item with water and/or with gasoline.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> It is used for the same thing as ReplaceOnUseOn, but allows multiple key/type mappings instead of only one.
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> These new methods were added to both Item and InventoryItem classes:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> [NODOT]<INDENT:40> String getReplaceType()
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> [NODOT]<INDENT:40> HashMap<String,String> getReplaceTypes()
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> [NODOT]<INDENT:40> String getReplaceType(String key)
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> [NODOT]<INDENT:40> boolean hasReplaceType(String key)
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> The existing ReplaceOnUseOn lines in items.txt add a new value to the item's ReplaceTypes HashMap.
[NODOT]<LINE>
Script properties item.staticModel and item.worldStaticModel are set to the fully-qualified "module.type" after loading scripts. This is to fix mod items not finding "model" scripts that aren't in the Base module.
[NODOT]<LINE>

[SECTION]SOUND CHANGES
Added global parameters Electricity, RoomType, and Water.
Added a new tile property named "AmbientSound" to support custom ambient sounds from objects. Current values assigned to some tiles are:
[NODOT]<INDENT:40> FactoryMachineAmbiance

Fixed Lua errors using the 16 new insect lures.  Definitions were missing in fishing_properties.lua.
Fixed the player's hair/skin changing after sleep
Fixed IsoWorldInventoryObject.ignoreRemoveSandbox not being saved.
Fixed the "Consolidate All" command so it combines drainable items one at a time, instead of waiting until the end of a longer combined action.

Fixed items being deselected when clicking the scrollbar in the inventory and loot windows.
Fixed inventory and loot container buttons responding to mouse-up events when the button wasn't clicked and items aren't being dropped on them. Dragging the scrollbar and then releasing the mouse button over a container button would act like a left click.

Reimplemented ZombieVocalsManager to limit zombie voice events to the nearest 20 zombies.

[NODOT]<BR>
Fixed ZombieVocalsManager not actually stopping vocal events when one of the 20 slots was reassigned to a different zombie.

[SECTION]BALANCE
Muffins produced by the "Get 6 Muffins" recipe have the name of the ingredient added to the muffins, if any, such as "Apple Muffin".
Muffins produced by the "Get 6 Muffins" recipe are marked "Cooked", so the hunger-reduction bonus due to being cooked is applied.
Fixed adding a spice to a stale Taco increases boredom and unhappiness.
Added new methods to the Food class (to fix the above issue):
