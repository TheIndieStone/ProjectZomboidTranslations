Muldraugh
 <LINE> <LINE>
 Muldraugh is a small town in an area the locals know as "Knox Country" -
 the dead centre of the State of Kentucky. It grew as an Army town, but now welcomes
 folks from all walks of life - some commuters to the bigger towns
 nearby, some military families and some living below the poverty line.

 It's a small place, filled with good people - not to mention Spiffo’s finest
 Chicken and Biscuits this side of Kentucky! Sure, not much happens here -
 but that doesn't mean Muldraugh life is dull...
