West Point

 Whether you're strolling through the town square, chowing on one of our pies
 or just chatting with friendly locals - West Point is the true Small Town USA.

 Don't let sleepy streets, affordable housing and acres
 of rolling farmland fool you - this is the Knox Country administrative
 hub. If our mayor isn't busy rubber-stamping public ordinances in the
 town hall, you might just find him in the famous Twiggy's Bar!
 No matter how long your stay: a West Point welcome is guaranteed!
