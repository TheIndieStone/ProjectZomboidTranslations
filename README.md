# Project Zomboid Translations

## Overview
This repository is for the video game Project Zomboid (https://projectzomboid.com/) translation files, to allow community translators a centralised location to collaborate and see when translations are updated by the developers.

## Contributing

There are two ways of contributing.

The first way, is to fork the repository (or find someone who has forked it and get access to contributing the repository) and make the necessary changes you need to, before initiating a pull request so that the changes can be folded into the main repository.

Or

The second way is to request access to this repository/organisation and use/create a branch associated with the language you are updating to make your changes in and then initiate a pull request for the changes to get merged in master branch.

The master branch acts as the default branch and reflects the live version of what gets distributed in the most recent build of the game. As such, the branch has been protected and therefore requires review before pull requests are merged in.

It is wise to seek out if contribution is actively happening with a language and join that effort, before starting up one on your own.

TAKE NOTE: We treat forks and branches as work in progress and we will not merge in these locations without a pull request.

Contributing to the repository is voluntary and abides by the Project Zomboid Terms & Conditions: https://projectzomboid.com/blog/2013/09/terms-conditions/

## TranslationZed

Some languages use different encoding (See #155), so GitHub might not show all symbols correctly. You can either use external editor to change encoding or use the TranslationZed tool to aid the translations that's available under https://github.com/TheIndieStone/ProjectZomboidTranslations/releases upload the files it saves.

Windows binaries are provided, but the jar can also be run with OpenJDK8 and OpenJFX8 on another platforms by running the jar with `java -jar` command. 

## Testing Translations Locally

To test the translations (or modify English texts) in your game, place the files from this repository in `â€¦\projectzomboid\media\lua\shared\Translate`

You can back up the original translation first and then replace the folder or copy/make a symbolic/hard link to a mirror of this repository.
