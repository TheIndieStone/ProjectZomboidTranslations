# Project Zomboid Translations

## Overview
This repository is for the video game Project Zomboid (https://projectzomboid.com/) translation files, to allow community translators a centralised location to collaborate and see when translations are updated by the developers.

## Contributing

There are two ways of contributing.

The first way, is to fork the repository (or find someone who has forked it and get access to contributing the repository) and make the necessary changes you need to, before initiating a pull request so that the changes can be folded into the main repository.

Or

The second way is to request access to this repository/organisation and use/create a branch associated with the language you are updating to make your changes in and then initiate a pull request for the changes to get merged in master branch.

The master branch acts as the default branch and reflects the live version of what gets distributed in the most recent build of the game. As such, the branch has been protected and therefore requires review before pull requests are merged in.

It is wise to seek out if contribution is actively happening with a language and join that effort, before starting up one on your own.

TAKE NOTE: We treat forks and branches as work in progress and we will not merge in these locations without a pull request.

## Joining As Contributor

If you want to join as a contributor instead of forking, then create an issue and notify Connall, send me a message on theindiestone.com or through Discord. There are numerous ways to get a hold of me.
