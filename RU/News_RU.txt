[VERSION] 39.66.3
[NEWS]
[BOLD]VEHICLES!
[BOLD]PLEASE NOTE: Due to the massive engine and gameplay changes required for vehicles, game saves from the previous build 38.30 are NOT compatible. If you want to continue your game a Steam beta channel for Build 38.30 has been provided.
[BOLD]PLEASE ALSO NOTE: Due to these huge changes to the PZ engine we can anticipate many bug reports, and also the potential of operational issues on computer set-ups that weren't part of our IWBUMS beta process. Please report any issues here, and thank you for patience.
[DOT2]Nine different vehicle models are available, not including variants on these such as branded vans, or emergency vehicles. So the PZ garage runs the gamut from family cars to police sedans, to Spiffo restaurant vans.
[DOT2]They can be found outside homes and in parking lots, while keys can be found in nearby homes, in the vehicle itself or on the floor. Hotwiring is also a skill option.
[DOT2]Players can replace spare parts, tyres, suspension, brakes and more, all of which can be damaged by situations such as overuse, off-road driving and collisions.
[DOT2]Vehicles must be topped up with gas, have charged batteries and each variety of vehicle has its own set of replacement parts for players to add to their chosen transport.
[DOT2]To accompany vehicles a Mechanic profession and skill have also been added to the game, allowing for increased chances of successful part installation, and trickier repairs.
[DOT2]The PZ map has been expanded, filling in the countryside between Riverside and Rosewood with farmsteads, camp sites and various nooks and crannies to explore in your cars, vans and ambulances. The official PZ online map has been updated with this.
[DOT2]A lot of optimization has been done under the hood to make way for vehicles: general map streaming performance, garbage collection improvements, UI framerate changes, rendering of non-visible internal tiles to provide smoother play around tall buildings etc.
[BOLD]Other new stuff:
New Sandbox options: CarDamageOnImpact, CarGeneralCondition, Enable Car Wreck Congestion etc.
Player craftable double doors and gates (wooden and metal) added to allow for vehicle storage in player-constructed bases.
Added darkening to levels below player's z height to help sense of depth between levels.
Added an AllowExteriorGenerator Sandbox option. This allows generators to power exterior tiles, and for example can get gas pumps working after the electricity has turned off.
Changed Xmx values to 1200 from 768 for 32/64 clients (should avoid too many pauses due to the garbage collector).
Switched to a Cellular Automaton (from a Mersenne) algorithm for RNG: this could be tough for players to see an impact, but changes in value should be less erratic). Also changed the seed generation. Now doing 2 seeds, one for Lua, one for Java.
Changed loot respawning to work at regular intervals. Starting at 7AM on the first day, loot respawns according to the LootRespawn sandbox option (in singleplayer) or the HoursForLootRespawn server option. So if loot is set to respawn every 24 hours, it will respawn at 7AM every day. There is a new sandbox option SeenHoursPreventLootRespawn. When > 0, loot will not respawn at the next loot-respawn time in zones that have been seen within that many hours.
Display progress when converting an old save to a new world version.
Added font-size option for inventory (and carpentry) tooltips.
Added line in literature tooltip to reflect when recipes are already unlocked by Profession and/or Traits.
Added debug scenarios to help in testing for devs and modders (Create a new character quickly from Main Menu, setup params, sandbox options etc. Check lua/client/DebugUIS/Scenario/DebugScenario, can only be used in Debug).
Added a -Dnosave argument in the command line for devs and modders. Use it to stop world saves when testing involves the creation of lots of new characters
Added debug option to display circle around character's feet.
Added UI for admins to inspect number of network packets sent/received.
Added tooltip showing Username on the Scoreboard and Mini-Scoreboard.
Added tooltip to Claim Safehouse context menu option when player hasn't survived long enough to be allowed to join.
Increase java heap max size on the Mac to match Windows/Linux (1200 MB).
Added "Quit to Desktop" button for when errors occur while loading a game.
Added "/safehouse release" command so clients can release a safehouse they own.
Added Moveables.txt translation file (for moveable-object names).
Added MultiStageBuild.txt translation file (for creating/upgrading walls).
UI now displays multi-stage build options even if a required recipe is unknown.
Added "ReloadWeapon" keybind ('R' by default).
Added support for duplicate keybindings and made changes to vehicle keybindings.
ESC key / B-button now cancels timed actions.
PlayerDownloadServer saves zip files to memory instead of to disk. This may improve lag issues.
Added CompostTime sandbox option.
DayLength sandbox option now allows all hours up to 24.
Added new town zones and foraging zones, especially around Riverside.
Added mailboxes to Riverside, alongside other general decoration map-wide.
Added "ItemNumbersLimitPerContainer" server option. It should be used to limit the numbers of items possible into one container.
In-game UI renders to a separate texture FBO at a lower framerate for optimisation purposes. (This can be disable in Options should it be desired.)
Doors can now be locked from inside without a key - including commercial buildings.
Added "Fill Grave" command to fill a grave to its capacity of five corpses.
Added better zoom in / zoom out radial-menu icons.
Added ErosionDays sandbox setting. (-1 means no erosion. 0 means use the existing ErosionSpeed option.  Any other value is the number of days until 100% growth. The maximum value is 36,500 days - 100 years).
Digital-watch alarms now beep for 30 in-game minutes before shutting off.
Added a warning to the Generator Info window and context-menu tooltips about toxicity.
Added missing options to the server-settings editor.
Player must face doors when locking/opening/unlocking.
Increased max java heap size to 2GB on 64-bit clients.
Increased map-download timeout from 30 to 60 seconds while connecting.
Client now downloads 20 chunks at a time while connecting to avoid timeouts.
Required skill level in the furniture-moving tooltip now shown.
Added individual translations for most Sandbox option values.
Added DebugOptions.TranslationPrefix to show an * before translated strings.
Inventory/loot windows now show a resize indicator when the mouse is between column headers.
Added context option for placing movables
Updated credits
Added a new 'Press 'R' to rotate during construction' tool tip to minimise Sasha's rotation despair
Made microwave/oven UI background a bit darker to improve visibility.
Host screen now displays an error and prevents launching servers with unsupported WorldVersion.
Sprites added to IsoObjectPicker.ThisFrame now limited to those near the mouse.
Updated server tool box invite player message.
Added ability to place one oversized item (item bigger than floor capacity) on the floor.
The multiplayer Tickets UI now handles long and multi-line tickets.
Updated newtiledefinitions.tiles with new FloorHeightXXX tile properties
Allow WallOverlay sprites to be used without an underlying wall sprite. (Mash uses these in a number of places but they've never appeared in-game.)
Game now allows only one faction invite dialog at a time from another user.
Rooms named emptyoutside (used by roof-hiding) are no longer treated as interior rooms. Emptyoutside rooms were placed in BuildingEd on roof-like bits that stick out from buildings as well as covered areas (at gas stations for example).
[BALANCE]

Radio/TV XP increased, and fixed discrepancy in bonus for halo display.
